# PCB Design files
This folder contains the Ki-Cad design files for the pCB including the PCB and layout. 

There really isnt much to say here, if you are fammiliar with PCB design you'll know what to do. If not, feel free to ask questions but the design isnt completely trivial.

The design uses all LCSC parts and can be ordered fully assembled through JLCPCB.
