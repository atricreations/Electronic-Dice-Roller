# Source code files
There are a handful of files that make up the source code of this device.

-char_set.py: Courtesy of chatgpt, this included the charaacter set used on the display. 
-config.py: Contains the configuration setting for the device. 
-main.py: Contains the main logic and functions. The entry point for the microcontroller. 
-neopixel.py: Contains the neopixel library.

For the most part, the only files that need to be modified are main.py and config.py, the other files are fairly static.
